Project Summary:

Polymer electrolytes are a class of materials widely studied for applications in energy storage and conversion devices, such as batteries and fuel cells, due to their ability to conduct ions while maintaining mechanical stability. Predicting their ionic conductivity, however, remains a significant challenge, as it depends on a complex interplay of polymer structure, ion–polymer interactions, and environmental conditions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been employed to model these behaviors and estimate conductivity, but they are often computationally expensive and limited in their ability to explore large chemical spaces efficiently. To address these limitations, we aim to leverage molecular descriptors to capture relevant chemical and structural information, thereby enhancing predictive capabilities. In this project, our goal is to optimize ionic conductivity prediction by enriching the dataset features using RDKit-generated descriptors and developing a novel machine learning model that can deliver more accurate and generalizable predictions.
