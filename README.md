Abstract:

Polymer electrolytes are a class of materials widely studied for applications in energy storage, such as batteries and fuel cells, due to their ability to conduct ions while maintaining mechanical stability. Predicting their ionic conductivity, however, remains a significant challenge, as it depends on a complex interplay of polymer structure, ion–polymer interactions, and environmental conditions. To alleviate experimental works, Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been employed to model polymer dynamics and estimate properties important to energy storage applications, but they are often computationally expensive and limited in their ability to explore large chemical spaces efficiently. To address these limitations, we aim to leverage molecular descriptors to capture relevant chemical and structural information, thereby enhancing predictive capabilities.

In this project, our goal is to optimize ionic conductivity prediction by enriching the dataset features using RDKit-generated descriptors and polymer physics knowledge. We will also create machine learning models known to be optimal for ionic conductivity prediction from previous literature and improve them by hyperparameter tuning and such to reach a more acceptable prediction. Ultimately, we hope to learn not only which polymer electrolyte features are important for ionic conductivity prediction, but also which machine learning models would be most suitable for electronic properties prediction that will produce comparable results to molecular dynamics.
